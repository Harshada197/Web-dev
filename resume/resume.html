<h2><u><b>ABOUT: </b></u></h2>
<p> I’m Harshada Dhas, a <b>second-year</b> B.Tech <b>Computer Science</b> student at <b>MKSSS’s Cummins College of Engineering, Pune</b>, driven by a passion for technology innovation and creative problem-solving.
As a member of ACM and an active contributor to the Graphics Team, I thrive in dynamic environments that challenge my technical and creative skills. Additionally, being a part of the Debating Society has strengthened my ability to articulate ideas, engage in intellectual discussions, and confidently present my thoughts.
I am deeply interested in public speaking and enjoy expressing my innovative and thoughtful ideas, bringing fresh perspectives to conversations. Always eager to learn and collaborate, I look forward to connecting with like-minded individuals and exploring new opportunities in the tech world!
